# DISTINCTIONS  
Distinctions are what specifically set the world of the campaign frame apart from other settings They are the tentpoles holding up the canvas of the campaign the supports a GM will build their story on top of They establish the pillars of the campaign including core truths about the setting major locations prominent groups or factions and narrative elements that contribute to the settingâ€™s atmosphere or themes (such as culture important historical events recent catastrophes conflicts and cosmology) and more Notably 
they do not include custom rules for the campaign frameâ€” those come later in their own section 
Distinctions also mark where the GMfacing information truly begins While GMs can share some information from this section with their players this is where you start layering in the secrets theyâ€™ll use to build compelling story arcs across 
their campaign
 BUILDING DISTINCTIONS 
Distinctions may be one of the first things you develop when creating the campaign frame since they serve as the pillars or core truths of that setting Consider the following ideas when writing out your campaign frameâ€™s distinctions: How the World Works: Convey the way magic functions in this setting (such as taking the form of technology in Motherboard) a prominent threat like a disease (such as the Serpentâ€™s Sickness in The Witherwild) or other major setting elements that will inform play (such as the Lure in Beast Feast)
 
Locations/Settlements: Detail major population centers 
(such as the Carrowcroft Walkaway and other walking cities in Motherboard or the outposts in Colossus of the Drylands) or prominent locations and landmarks (such as Brilliance in Beast 
Feast)  
Core Philosophies and Ideologies: Highlight any cultural philosophical or ideological ideas that differentiate the setting such as the way magic users are met with suspicion in 
The Age of Umbra 
Major Figures: Establish the gods or other powerful beings key to the setting (such as the gods in The Witherwild or the Children of Godfell in Colossus of the Drylands) Ideally the distinctions provide the baseline for tables to 
build on the provided materials with their own ideas The writeup doesnâ€™t need to be encyclopedic especially if youâ€™re sticking to the capsule format of the campaign frames from the core rulebook which are designed to be inspirational 
and intentionally left incomplete to invite GM and player contributions
 
INCITING INCIDENT  
The inciting incident is a sample opening to a campaign using the frame Itâ€™s designed to introduce the party to the core themes and some of the frameâ€™s distinctions while illustrating one possible approach for a GM to begin the campaign  

BUILDING AN INCITING 
INCIDENT 
Inciting incidents are the intersection of three elements: 
adventure design character hooks and setting introduction 
They usually take the form of a situation and an objective for 
the PCs to complete with an individual or faction asking the 
PCs to intervene 
You could build the situation and objective first then decide 
what character hooks help motivate a variety of PCs to get 
involved Alternatively you could start with the hooks you 
think will be most motivating for PCs in this campaign frame 
then decide what situation or objective can best support or 
create those character hooks  
Ideally an inciting incident provides a bitesize example of the 
kinds of stories the campaign frame is set up to tell addresses 
some or all of the listed themes incorporates some of the 
distinctions and presents a chance to show off the frameâ€™s 
custom mechanics 

# CUSTOM MECHANICS  
Each campaign frame includes new game mechanics and tools 
that represent elements unique to the campaign frame that 
enhance the experience of playing in its setting Sometimes 
these mechanics are born from the genre tropes the campaign 
frame employs and other times theyâ€™re tools to support the 
frameâ€™s unique lore 
Your custom mechanics might aim to impact the campaign in 
any of the following ways (or another way entirely!): 
â€¢ They add more detail to an aspect of the world (like the 
corruption mechanics in The Witherwild and the rules for 
dangerous rests in The Age of Umbra)  
â€¢ They introduce new items and adversary systems (like the 
guns and colossi in Colossus of the Drylands) 
â€¢ They offer additional subsystems that help the GM keep 
track of moving parts while ensuring the story moves 
forward (like the faction projects system in Five Banners 
Burning)  
This section clearly marks where youâ€™re homebrewing 
Daggerheartâ€™s rules to fulfill your creative goals in the 
campaign frame Having a specific section also makes it easy 
for potential players to find and understand how the rules 
change for this specific game Keep the design principles from 
the beginning of this homebrew kit in mind when creating 
custom mechanicsâ€”if you find yourself adding mechanics 
that diverge from those principles consider adding new player 
or GM principles to your campaign frame to bridge the gap 
between your new mechanics and Daggerheartâ€™s core design 
approach

# Session 0 
These are new questions specific to the campaign frame that 
should be asked during a session zero These questions should 
both help situate your PCs in the setting and prompt groups 
to articulate how they want to address or handle important 
thematic or content elements of the campaign (such as gore 
the impact of war or intraparty conflict)
 For inspiration look to both the session zero questions 
for the campaign frames in the core rulebook and also 
the background and connection questions in each classâ€™s 
character guide 
CAMPAIGN MAP 
Providing a map can be helpful for orienting players within 
your campaign frameâ€™s setting Maps for Daggerheart 
campaign frames are designed with some locations filled in 
and plenty of space left for groups to make the map their own 
Consider adding a list of names to the map that thematically 
f
 it the worldâ€”GMs can prompt players to choose from these 
names and place them on the map building out the setting 
together so everyone feels ownership of the story
